I was looking for a class that could help me take a breather and relax during my busy schedule, and I signed up for acting because it sounded fun. I&#39;ve always had a passion for theater, and my Dad is an actor. This ended up quickly becoming my favorite class. I loved all the people in it and looked forward to it every week. One of the big assignments of the quarter was memorizing and performing a monologue. I chose this monologue about a woman being stalked, and I really fell in love with the piece. I remember performing it in class and actually crying.

It definitely was, I left with a 3.8 GPA, but it helped me realize I wasn&#39;t happy being an Earth and Space Science major. While I did fine in science and math, it wasn&#39;t where my heart was. I ended up looking up other majors by the end of the quarter.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-5bs0n5">REFLECTION</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nbqkhg">The Fall Quarter of 2022 was one of the most exciting by far. I loved being on campus and establishing a routine while making new friends and finding new passions. I kept busy, and there was never a dull moment in what I was doing. It allowed me to think about myself in ways I hadn&#39;t before, and I like to think I grew as a person during this time in my life. For starters, figuring out I didn&#39;t want to be a STEM major was a big moment. I remember crying over Chemistry while visiting home and talking about the experience with my Mom. She asked me if I wanted to pursue STEM, and I had to think about it. The truth was-- I didn&#39;t-- but I had convinced myself of the idea that if I was not doing STEM, then I&#39;m not smart. I&#39;ve been surrounded by friends my whole life who have gone on to pursue careers in engineering and physics, and they always seemed wise to me. If I went into the humanities, I would never be as good as them. My Mom reminded me of all the people I thought were brilliant pursuing careers in journalism and psychology, these paths that I just never really considered. I ended up calling my friend Lauren about it, and she&#39;s the one who recommended the major of Sociology. I started the switch to it by the end of the year.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-mhq74">I also found my community in the Fall within Alpha Phi Omega. I never really felt like I had a group when I was growing up. I had friends, but none of them ran in the same circles. It wasn&#39;t until Alpha Phi Omega that I thought, &quot;these are my people.&quot; It was such a freeing moment. Being a Pledge Educator of APO was hard. It was a long night and a lot of mediating for different personalities, but I loved every second of it. I enjoyed teaching and being someone the pledges could count on. I loved volunteering with my brothers, hanging out at each other&#39;s places, or grabbing lunch; it was all so special to me.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-7br8gk">I started getting into acting on TikTok. There are a ton of, accothere are many that focus on characters from my favorite TV shows and movies. I started auditioning for them, creating content around cosplay, and I began to grow. I got cast in a few things and found a lot of friends through the online discord groups I would talk with every day and even Zoom. Acting became my crutch when responsibilities stressed me. Theater became something I could lean on when things got too hard.</p>  <hr>  <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-16t2la1">winter 2022 — <q>1 step forward, 3 steps back</q></h2> <ul class="class-schedule svelte-1g9ruif" data-svelte-h="svelte-x5bcn7"><li>drama 252</li> <li>honors 231</li> <li>soc 300</li></ul> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/sophomore/wi/soundoff.jpg" alt="wi21 sound off">  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-10qyl9k">I got a call in December 2021 that my band (who released an album in 2020 and basically fizzled out) made it to being one of the twelve participants in Museum of Pop Culture&#39;s Sound Off. I screamed in the car when I was done with the call, as I had dreamed of being in Sound Off since I heard about it in 2019. I spent the next couple months gathering up musicians and practicing every week. Sound Off consumed my time, and it took a lot of effort to balance school and music. It was worth every second though. I performed in their Sky Auditorium and it was easily one of the best days of my life.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-ro9nv0">The past quarter I got into acting, and in Winter, I started auditioning. I found the Lux Production Club on campus and got the lead role in their short film &quot;Production Bible.&quot; It was an all-day shoot, and I loved the cast and crew I worked with. I got to have fun with the character and even adlibbed one of my lines. It was the first acting credit I earned outside of class, and I was proud of myself.</p>  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/sophomore/wi/lux.png" alt="sp21 lux">  </div> </div> </div> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/sophomore/wi/daily_article.png" alt="wi22 daily article about female seattle musicians">  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-nm4a9d">Since Freshman year, I had been trying to become a writer at the UW Daily. I was a journalist all throughout highschool, and applied for the college paper every quarter. I finally made it on during Winter and had the opportunity to take their Development Class where I was eventually hired. The first article I wrote was about earthquake technology, and it is linked below.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-5bs0n5">REFLECTION</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rhy6f9">If Acting dominated my mind during autumn, it was music that became a part of me during winter. I spent most nights working on my original music for Sound of 2022 and practicing with my band. I found most musicians through the Songwriters Club on campus, although a few were just personal friends. I had wanted the band to amp back up again during 2021, but it was hard to find people who were committed to the cause. Sound Off gave me all the opportunity I needed. The performance was rushed, and the number of people who came to see me almost made me cry. I loved performing my original songs with my bandmates, and it&#39;s an experience I won&#39;t forget.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-yapp8e">As the quarter went on, I played more and more shows. I kept getting booked for everything, and I finally felt like I was creating a space for myself in the Seattle music industry. By the end of the winter quarter, I had played five shows in two months.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1oduwzk">My acting didn&#39;t slow down, though. I kept going out and auditioning, and I signed myself up for Backstage to find casting calls outside the campus. I got headshots done by a family friend and enjoyed sipping my morning coffee and scrolling through the casting calls. Writing for the Daily was excellent too. I spent most of the quarter working on a piece about the primates at the UW primate center and how PETA is suing them. That piece took me several months, as it was hard to get accurate quotes from both parties, and the legality of it all was dicey. I didn&#39;t miss that about journalism. I love reporting the truth and delivering the news while it&#39;s hot, but it&#39;s a pain to fact-check every single sentence you write.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ojzqk1">This was also the first quarter where I wasn&#39;t focused on STEM but instead taking sociology classes. It was interesting. I liked the course I took, although it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Sociology made me feel like a profiler, though. I enjoyed thinking from other people&#39;s perspectives and analyzing how that applied to different situations. After a couple of weeks of my Sociology theories class, I thought, &quot;I think I&#39;m going to like it here.&quot;</p>  <hr>  <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1afkg2m">spring 2022 — <q>good 4 u</q></h2> <ul class="class-schedule svelte-1g9ruif" data-svelte-h="svelte-1bdx2w6"><li>soc 357</li> <li>honors 212</li> <li>clas 430</li></ul> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/sophomore/sp/gig.jpg" alt="sp22 gig">  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-8q8ox5">Throughout Winter and Spring quarter I performed several times at venues around town.

This was one of my favorite classes I&#39;ve taken at UW. Usually, I don&#39;t love lectures, but Pfaff is excellent at commanding an audience, and the ideas taught were fascinating. For our final project, we had to observe a religious congregation. I woke up bright and early to go to church and wrote my paper on their practices.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-5bs0n5">REFLECTION</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1u89bl0">The Spring quarter ended on an upbeat note. I finally finished my sociology requirements, so I could apply to my new major, got elected as PR/Marketing Chair of Alpha Phi Omega, and had a lot of fun hangouts with friends. Unfortunately, I also lost some friendships that hurt me in the long run.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6b69xn">Since my first year, I have been friends with a group of girls (one of them being my dorm roommate). They stopped talking to me during the spring quarter, and I never knew why. I was trying to organize a lunch for all three of us, and that&#39;s when one of them texted me saying she didn&#39;t want to be friends anymore-- we weren&#39;t compatible. I think that was code, for I didn&#39;t party as much as them (I prefer coffee and a good book, but I&#39;ll enjoy the occasional party). My roommate texted simultaneously, saying, &quot;she didn&#39;t see my texts,&quot; which was utterly malarky, and we all knew it. I felt so heartbroken, and I blamed myself. I was visiting the home at the time, and my Mom found me in my bed staring at my phone before I eventually broke down crying. Luckily, my friends who did matter rallied around me. They were so kind and thoughtful during that time, and I am thankful for them.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-29npx6">I loved being able to get in touch with my art again. I did another LUX production called Point Four Zero with one of my friends, Connor, who I met in acting class. I performed concerts with my band, wrote articles on plays and the UW Primate Center for the Daily, and even got back into drawing. I missed the part of me that loved all things creative. It felt like during COVID that it all faded away. I would nap and play video games, never enjoying the same things as I used to. It felt good to get in touch with that side of myself again.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ew1hm0">My sophomore year ended nicely, and hopefully, the junior year will bring the same level of eventfulness as I enter the last half of my undergraduate career.</p> </main> </div>
