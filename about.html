My name is Gillian, and I’m a 22-year-old living in Seattle, WA. I was raised in Portland, OR with my parents and my cats. While at the University of Washington, I studied Sociology with a minor in Acting. I’m heading to Columbia Publishing afterwards in hopes of working in book publishing. While on campus, I have been a staff writer for the Daily and was formally apart of Alpha Phi Omega. In my free time, you can find me with my cat, Butters, napping, or singing and songwriting in my band, the Sleepy Haunts.</p> </div> </div> <hr> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-lyb23k">I started freshman year as a STEM major, with friends I made in the dorms. Still, I went through a depressive episode and questioned my academic choices. Freshman year to me is characterized by Lizzy McAlpine’s five seconds flat, which is all about the feelings of heartbreak and rebirth.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1lhlbgm">“God, it’s brutal out here,” is the main line in the opening track of SOUR by Olivia Rodrigo. Even though I was starting to find my place during my sophomore year of college, academics were hard and I was learning the ins-and-outs of the music industry in a way that was complex. By the end of sophomore year, I had changed from being STEM to Sociology. My band was actually getting traction. We were moving from sour to sweet.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-bqd0v8">Unfortunately, nothing wonderful ever lasts. I started junior year with a loss of friends. Then I went to study abroad, which was wonderful, until I was so sick that it left my temporarily deaf. Afterwards though, I reevaluated and I grew. The themes of Punisher by Phoebe Bridgers inspired my junior year. “I want to believe, instead I look at the sky and I feel nothing,” sings Bridgers on her song Chinese Satellite (a song about yearning to believe, but not being able to).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1t79box">Even though I got better in junior year (chose new friends, found new passions), it wasn’t all well and done. I had a major falling out at the beginning of senior year, and my reputation in several circles was tarnished. Which is why, Reputation by Taylor Swift was the perfect album for my senior year. It was all about the “villain era,” and the subsequent healing that comes with setting healthy boundaries.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1464z9x">“And what it all comes down to, is that everything is going to be fine fine fine.” That’s my thought process exiting my undergraduate career, and it’s the mantra I’ll be singing as I walk across the stage at graduation.</p></main> </div>
