It allowed me to think about myself in ways I hadn't before, and I like to think I grew as a person during this time in my life. For starters, figuring out I didn't want to be a STEM major was a big moment. I remember crying over Chemistry while visiting home and talking about the experience with my Mom. She asked me if I wanted to pursue STEM, and I had to think about it. The truth was-- I didn't-- but I had convinced myself of the idea that if I was not doing STEM, then I'm not smart. I've been surrounded by friends my whole life who have gone on to pursue careers in engineering and physics, and they always seemed wise to me. If I went into the humanities, I would never be as good as them. My Mom reminded me of all the people I thought were brilliant pursuing careers in journalism and psychology, these paths that I just never really considered.
