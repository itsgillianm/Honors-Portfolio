It involves discipline and responsibility as I had to plan all the recording sessions, get in contact with a producer, and make sure everyone was sounding good for the release. Overall, it taught me leadership skills as well as served as an outlet for my creativity.`,p,w,j,y,N,H,v,T=`For my Honors class, Lovework, this quarter we had to read a choice book and analyze it's themes of love.

After having my Mom visit after two weeks, I started to feel a lot better. She and I talked, and when she left, I felt much more prepared. I began to try and challenge myself to do more than sitting around in my dorm all day. I made meal plans and tried to cook once a week for my roommate and boyfriend, which was exciting but overall satisfying (I made a lot of pasta). I created a cleaning schedule so my dorm didn't become a mess. My favorite was every Wednesday; I would go to Tea Republik on the Ave and study for two hours with my boyfriend (by study, I mean that he helped me with math homework the whole time).",F,q,V="My roommate and I became close, and we relied on each other as we both struggled to get used to our new environment.

In October, I participated in the challenge "Inktober," where you have to draw something using ink for each day of October following a specific prompt. I finished all 31 drawings, and some of them I like so much I turned them into full prints that I'd like to sell someday. For November, I participated in NaNoWriMo, the national writing competition where you have to write 50,000 words in November. I wrote an original novel called "Cupid's Got a Bad Aim" and got around 30,000 words. While I haven't finished the book yet, I'm pretty proud of myself as I tried to write about 4,000 words a day. I also consulted my Professor, Jeanette Bushnell, for help on my book since I'm in her honors class on love, and my book was on the topic of the philosophy of love. Finally, my biggest project was finishing my first full-length albumâ€” "Queendom." I started working on this album earlier this year, but my efforts were halted because of coronavirus. I started recording it at home and would only go into the studio to record the drum parts with my bandmate. We finally finished it this month of November and can release it on December 1st.
