I thought my classes sounded interesting, I was president of my fraternity, and my band was doing okay. Unfortunately, it ended up being a really hard time for me mentally. One thing about me, is I have a very dry sarcastic sense of humor. One of the people in my fraternity was offended by that sense of humor, and we ended up having a falling out (I tried to apologize, but she wouldn’t accept that). It escalated to me being reported to the board for my behavior. Eventually, no one wanted work with me anymore and started essentially bullying me.

I started really looking inward as to why I make friendships like these, and sought out answers within myself for how I could be better moving forward. I started to heal, even though classes were hard. My Directing class was incredibly stressful. It was a lot of work, and the teacher wasn’t always the most receptive. I also struggled in my honors class, where all the students were fairly convinced that the teacher actually had no idea what the class was about.
