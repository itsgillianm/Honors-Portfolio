Recording an album is more than just writing some songs and putting them into your computer. It involves discipline and responsibility as I had to plan all the recording sessions, get in contact with a producer, and make sure everyone was sounding good for the release. Overall, it taught me leadership skills as well as served as an outlet for my creativity.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-jy11jr">For my Honors class, Lovework, this quarter we had to read a choice book and analyze it&#39;s themes of love.

I had to attend several classes this quarter to learn more about the fraternity and I recently passed the test and became a full blown member. Part of my initiation meant performing minimum three hours of community service, which I fulfilled by writing letters to elders in senior homes. this community that I&#39;ve discovered in APO has helped me find a place within the college.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-5bs0n5">REFLECTION</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-kvciqi">In my first quarter at college, I had many questions about what to do and how to act in my new environment. The first couple of weeks were particularly hard, as I missed my family and wasn&#39;t used to being on my own. Having suffered from anxiety and depression my whole life, I struggled and frequently ended up in my car, wondering if I should go home. After having my Mom visit after two weeks, I started to feel a lot better. She and I talked, and when she left, I felt much more prepared. I began to try and challenge myself to do more than sitting around in my dorm all day. I made meal plans and tried to cook once a week for my roommate and boyfriend, which was exciting but overall satisfying (I made a lot of pasta). I created a cleaning schedule so my dorm didn&#39;t become a mess. My favorite was every Wednesday; I would go to Tea Republik on the Ave and study for two hours with my boyfriend (by study, I mean that he helped me with math homework the whole time).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-yuk9n4">My roommate and I became close, and we relied on each other as we both struggled to get used to our new environment. I felt thankful because I was so used to horror stories of lousy roommates that I was glad I had a roommate I was happy to spend time with. As I got more comfortable in my classes, I gained more confidence and felt better in my new environment. My classes challenged me without being too taxing, and I maintained a socially distanced social life and got good marks.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-psobem">I could also pursue my creative projects on the side, which led me to set goals. In October, I participated in the challenge &quot;Inktober,&quot; where you have to draw something using ink for each day of October following a specific prompt. I finished all 31 drawings, and some of them I like so much I turned them into full prints that I&#39;d like to sell someday. For November, I participated in NaNoWriMo, the national writing competition where you have to write 50,000 words in November. I wrote an original novel called &quot;Cupid&#39;s Got a Bad Aim&quot; and got around 30,000 words. While I haven&#39;t finished the book yet, I&#39;m pretty proud of myself as I tried to write about 4,000 words a day. I also consulted my Professor, Jeanette Bushnell, for help on my book since I&#39;m in her honors class on love, and my book was on the topic of the philosophy of love. Finally, my biggest project was finishing my first full-length album— &quot;Queendom.&quot; I started working on this album earlier this year, but my efforts were halted because of coronavirus. I started recording it at home and would only go into the studio to record the drum parts with my bandmate. We finally finished it this month of November and can release it on December 1st. I&#39;m so excited about it as I wrote every song on it, and it&#39;s my most competitive project to date.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15xdltj">As I near the end of my first quarter at the University of Washington, I understand why some describe college as the best years of their life because it is a rewarding experience. I&#39;ve met many new people that I can see myself being friends with for a long time, and I&#39;ve learned valuable lessons that will help shape my future. I&#39;m eager to get into Winter Quarter and start to involve myself with more organizations and opportunities so I can get the most out of my freshman year. Unlike how I started my autumn quarter, I know I&#39;ll enter this next one without fear.</p>  <hr>  <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-ads4m3">winter 2021 — <q>doomsday</q></h2> <ul class="class-schedule svelte-1g9ruif" data-svelte-h="svelte-1y9qhqy"><li>chem 142</li> <li>ess 100</li> <li>math 124</li> <li>art 272</li></ul> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-k0oti6">For my art class, our final project took the form of a visual diary.

Chemistry was really hard and despite my work, I barely pulled through with a 2.5 GPA. I attended every office hour, met with my TA on a regular basis, paid for extra tutoring, and spent hours after classes hitting the books and trying to understand the content. Most days afterwards I found myself crying in my desk from the frustration of it all.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-9uasil">I also struggled in Calculus during this quarter. I did tutoring for this class as well as got help outside to try and understand what was going on. The difference though is I managed to pull through with a 3.1 GPA which is much higher than I was expecting. I was really proud of myself. I managed to get this grade despite being unable to finish any of the final exams on time due to the short time constraint.</p>  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/freshman/wi/math124.png" alt="wi21 math 124 grades">  </div> </div> </div> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-5bs0n5">REFLECTION</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1sehc6e">My second quarter in college tested my mental health in ways I haven&#39;t experienced before. My classes were challenging, and I descended into a pit of depression. I found myself feeling suicidal, and I rarely hung out with friends or left my dorm. I cried every night, and bringing myself to go to class felt exhausting because I didn&#39;t have any hope that I&#39;d succeed. I eventually went home a week before spring break to recalibrate. I started seeing a new therapist. I was rediagnosed with major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and general anxiety disorder. In addition, I was also diagnosed with ADHD.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-sj38d9">The beginning of the quarter was tarnished with heartache on top of my depression. MY cat of ten years passed away the day I got my wisdom teeth removed. I went into the hospital a week later for complications. To some people, losing a pet might not seem like much, but it broke my heart into tiny pieces for me. That cat was my best friend for years. His name was Garfield, but we called him the Mister. He was an orange Exotic Shorthair and had the cutest flat snout and stocky body. His meow sounded more like a &quot;wah,&quot; and his personality was bigger than words. He had been diagnosed with cancer the first day of the winter quarter.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qjmcpm">We had found blood in his mouth and took him to the vet, who told us he had mouth cancer. The last night before he passed away, I was sleeping and anxiously waiting for my surgery the upcoming morning. He came into my room and climbed up on my bed, nudging me with his paws until I finally let him into my arms. He never wanted to sleep in my arms. Usually, he tried to sleep on my pillow, but he wanted to be right against my chest that night. I pet his head and body until we both fell asleep. The following day I went into surgery, and he went to the vet to get his mouth checked on. When I woke up from the surgery, I felt tears streaming down my face, and I couldn&#39;t explain why. I was wheeled out to my Mom&#39;s car and sent home, where I slept for several hours until waking up again. I remember waking up from my nap and seeing my Mom, who had this sad look on her face I wasn&#39;t used to. She told me that the Mister passed away while I was in surgery. It was then I knew why I was crying; I could just sense he was gone.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-10t5wc1">My birthday is on February 22nd, one of the few happy days of the quarter where I spent time with friends and hit Capitol Hill for dinner; it was on my birthday that I got a new cat. Her name is Daisy Mae, and she&#39;s a calico Persian with a larger-than-life personality. She likes to walk sideways across the floor, purr when she sees squirrels, and sit on top of my laptop and try to type out my emails for me. She&#39;s brought life back into my house when it felt cold, and I&#39;m thankful for her every day.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-10w5ly0">This quarter wasn&#39;t the best, it was sad to follow up on the overall okay autumn quarter, but it taught me a lot about grief that I am thankful for. Not everything in life can be happy, but you can learn more about yourself through sadness than you can just happiness.</p>  <hr>  <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-yr0q42">spring 2021 — <q>orange show speedway</q></h2> <ul class="class-schedule svelte-1g9ruif" data-svelte-h="svelte-t8fv46"><li>math 125</li> <li>engl 282</li> <li>honors 212</li></ul> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/freshman/sp/seattle_musicians.jpg" alt="sp21 seattle musicians article">  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-6a9aa">This was my favorite project of my first year of college.

I researched through various academic outlets as well as memoirs penned by famous musicians and ultimately created this zine to highlight my research.

I decided to create a comic highlighting a story in a video game I play, Cozy Grove, where you play a spirit scout who has to help these bear spirits move on from life. This was the cover of my comic, and it is one of my favorite pieces. I hadn&#39;t done a digital painting before, so it allowed me to explore a different medium while creating something I was proud of.</p>  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/freshman/sp/cozy_art.png" alt="sp21 cozy grove art">  </div> </div> </div> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/freshman/sp/math125.png" alt="sp21 math 125 grades">  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-151bpm0">Last quarter I really struggled in Calculus, so when I took it again this quarter I wanted it to play out differently than before.

I was really proud of myself.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-5bs0n5">REFLECTION</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1n2jfqh">My third quarter in college made the end of my freshman year memorable. I pulled myself out of the pit of depression before and managed to find the good things in life again. I took classes I enjoyed, had experiences with friends, and ultimately felt sad when I left my dorms to move back home. I started seeing a new therapist in Seattle who helped me, and I got put on different meds and medication specifically for anxiety. My roommate started experiencing the same depression I felt the previous quarter, though, and it broke my heart to watch her fall into that pit I was so familiar with. I tried to support her the best I could, just like she supported me. I am grateful she was my roommate because, in return, she became one of my best friends.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-v2b595">I spent a lot of time building connections in the spring quarter. I was elected pledge educator of my fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, and I was able to teach my first quarter of pledges. Many of my frat members who were off-campus the past quarter came on campus, so I was able to see them. One of those people was Anna, my big, and we spent a lot of time together. We went to the farmers market, MoPop, got dinner and shared lots of laughs. I also bonded with another student in the honors program, Lauren, who quickly became one of my best friends at college. It&#39;s crazy thinking I met her on zoom, and we bonded off-campus.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1izjpkh">Even though I made a lot of connections, I also spent time reevaluating friendships I already had. I was tired of spending time with people who never put effort into reaching out to me and being my friend. I knew it wasn&#39;t because they didn&#39;t like it; I just wasn&#39;t a high priority in their life. I stopped reaching out to those people and instead made connections with those who wanted to be in my life. I found a weight fell off my shoulders when I did that.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-hkm75o">The Spring quarter allowed me to look forward to summer plans. I got a job working at Ulta Beauty that would start when I get home. I have made plans with my band to write more music and play more shows. I also signed up for a digital art class that will improve my line work and character design. I want to focus on my passions and myself while I&#39;m at home to return to school ready to engage with others again. I thank this past quarter for allowing me time to reflect so that when I return in autumn, I&#39;m more ready than ever.</p> </main> </div>
