We ended the course creating projects based on themes of the course, and I decided to write a song. I really loved the apocalyptic themes in the novel, so I wrote my song based off of that. My favorite line in the song was one at the end of the novel: “I can’t swim but I’ll learn how.”</p>  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><iframe slot="img" height="100px" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c9y4W6ry1p6z5k8QkeYoR9zPtAO-hvk_/preview" title="Google drive file preview" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div> </div> </div> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-pi9kqa">I’ve been diligently working on new music, and in December I released an EP titled “bloom, vol .1.” I was unbelievably proud of the work that went into it. I had an EP release party at Seattle Records on the Ave, and it had a good turn out with lots of friends and even strangers. My favorite song on it is “why do I feel this way.”</p>  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><iframe slot="img" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0hrZkighE4cBm7IVxsC7xX?utm_source=generator" title="Spotify album preview" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div> </div> </div> <div class="page-block svelte-zixtor"><div class="container column-container svelte-s05936"><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:0.5"><img slot="img" src="./images/senior/au/directing.jpg" alt="au23 directing">  </div><div class="column v-center svelte-1cuk7zf" style="--width-factor:1"><p slot="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-1t0onys">My most strenuous class was Directing. Our final project, was to write, direct, and stage a play of our own creation. I wrote a play that was inspired by my love for horror, and final girls. I cast my friends Connor and Chloe to play the main characters. I ended up getting a pretty good grade on the play!</p>  </div> </div> </div> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-5bs0n5">REFLECTION</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-x80c2">I went into my last autumn quarter really excited for all the work to occur. I thought my classes sounded interesting, I was president of my fraternity, and my band was doing okay. Unfortunately, it ended up being a really hard time for me mentally. One thing about me, is I have a very dry sarcastic sense of humor. One of the people in my fraternity was offended by that sense of humor, and we ended up having a falling out (I tried to apologize, but she wouldn’t accept that). It escalated to me being reported to the board for my behavior. Eventually, no one wanted work with me anymore and started essentially bullying me. I sent in my resignation, letting them know that I felt bullied, and didn’t return since.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-htg228">This sent me into a depression, further highlighted by more friends deciding not to talk to me anymore (because I put in “too much effort”). I was feeling very aimless, and alone. A community that I’ve had since freshman year was gone. I felt utterly alone.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1x57s65">I took that pain though, and channeled it into my music and the friends that stayed and fought for me. I started really looking inward as to why I make friendships like these, and sought out answers within myself for how I could be better moving forward. I started to heal, even though classes were hard. My Directing class was incredibly stressful. It was a lot of work, and the teacher wasn’t always the most receptive. I also struggled in my honors class, where all the students were fairly convinced that the teacher actually had no idea what the class was about. My favorite class was Murder with Professor Ann Frost. It was extremely interesting, and I loved being able to tell people “I’m taking a class called Murder!” Overall, I ended the year happy, and that’s what was important for me.</p> </main> </div>
